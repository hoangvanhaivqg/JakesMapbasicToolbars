Jake's MapBasic Toolbar
=======================

A selection of useful tools for MapInfo written in mapBasic.


Requirements
============

These programs have been written in MapBasic 10.5. They *may* work on some older versions but I have no way of testing this. They definitely *don't* compile on v6.5 or earlier. Please let me know if you have tried/succeeded/failed to compile them on an earlier version.


Features
========

__Batch export plans__
Export one plan per record in table with just a few clicks. 
 * Choose output size and resolution. 
 * Override the layer styles
 * 13 different output file formats, including PNG, BMP, WMF, JPEG, TIFF, PSD, EMF etc.

__Export MIF DXF and SHP at once__


__Show unmapped records__


__Save and Recall Mapper Location__

Save a map window's location and zoom setting for quicker navigation. Similar to the NamedViews program that comes with MapInfo but saves views to a table to be used per-workspace rather than per-installation.

__Window Tool__

* Create basic A4/A3 landscape/portrait layout windows from other windows.
* Rename windows
* Duplicate windows
* Rotate windows (beta)

__Projection Tool__
 * Find projection information and other information about tables and windows

__Circle Tool (beta)__
* Draw a circle of a given area/radius/circumference
**Note:** This works but has bugs. It seems to work fine *except* on the workspace which I use to test my programs, and I don't know why! Use with caution!

__LineTool (beta)__
 * A simple line tool. Basically a duplicate of MapInfo's built-in line tool.
