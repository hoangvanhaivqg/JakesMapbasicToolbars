Jake's MapBasic Toolbars
========================

A selection of useful tools for MapInfo written in mapBasic.


Requirements
============

These programs have been written in MapBasic 10.5. They *may* work on some older versions but I have no way of testing this. They definitely *don't* compile on v6.5 or earlier. Please let me know if you have tried/succeeded/failed to compile them on an earlier version.


Toolbar
============

* Batch export plans - export one plan per record in table with just a few clicks. 
** Choose output size and resolution. 
** Override the layer styles
** 13 different output file formats, including PNG, BMP, WMF, JPEG, TIFF, PSD, EMF etc.

* Show overlapping objects

* Update areas

* Export MIF/DXF/SHP


View App
============
* Save window locations and zooms for quicker navigation. Similar to NamedViews that comes with MapInfo but saves views to a table to be used per-workspace rather than per-installation.


Window Tool
==========
* Create basic A4/A3 landscape/portrait layout windows from other windows.
* Rename windows
* Duplicate windows
* Rotate windows (beta)

Projection Tool
===============

* Find projection information and other information about tables and windows

Circle Tool (beta)
======================
* Draw a circle of a given area/radius/circumference

**Note:** This works but has bugs. It seems to work fine *except* on the workspace which I use to test my programs, and I don't know why! Use with caution!


LineTool (beta)
====================
* A simple line tool. Basically a duplicate of MapInfo's built-in line tool.
