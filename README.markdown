Jakes MapBasic Toolbars
=======================

A selection of useful tools for MapInfo written in mapBasic.


Requirements
============

These programs have been written in MapBasic 10.5. They *may* work on some older versions but I have no way of testing this. They definitely *don't* compile on v6.5 or earlier. Please let me know if you have tried/succeeded/failed to compile them on an earlier version.


Contents
========

JakesToolbar
------------
* Batch export plans - export one plan per record in table with just a few clicks.

* Show unmapped records
* Show overlapping objects
* Update areas
* Export MIF/DXF/SHP


JakesCircleTool (beta)
----------------------
* Draw a circle of a given area/radius/circumference
This works but has bugs. It seems to work fine *except* on the workspace I use to test programs., and I don't know why.


JakesViewApp
------------
* Save window locations and zooms for quicker navigation. Similar to NamedViews that comes with MapInfo but saves views to a table rather than per-installation.


WindowTool
----------
* Create basic A4/A3 landscape/portrait layout windows from other windows.
* Rename windows
* Duplicate windows
* Rotate windows (beta)
