Jake's MapBasic Toolbar
=======================

A selection of useful tools for MapInfo written in mapBasic.


Requirements
============

These programs have been written in MapBasic 10.5. They *may* work on some older versions but I have no way of testing this. They definitely *don't* compile on v6.5 or earlier. Please let me know if you have tried/succeeded/failed to compile them on an earlier version.


Features
========

<dt>Save and Recall Mapper Location</dt>
<dd> Save a map window's location and zoom setting for quicker navigation. Similar to the NamedViews program that comes with MapInfo but saves views to a table to be used per-workspace rather than per-installation.</dd>

<dt>Window Tool</dt>
<dd>
* Create basic A4/A3 landscape/portrait layout windows from other windows.
* Rename windows
* Duplicate windows
* Rotate windows (beta)

<dt>Circle Tool (beta)</dt>
<dd> * Draw a circle of a given area/radius/circumference
**Note:** This works but has bugs. It seems to work fine *except* on the workspace which I use to test my programs, and I don't know why! Use with caution!</dd>

<dt>LineTool (beta)</dt>
<dd> * A simple line tool. Basically a duplicate of MapInfo's built-in line tool.</dd>
